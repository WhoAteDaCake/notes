\section{Quality assurance and standards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Standards may be international, national, organizational or project based
  \item Product standards define characteristics that all components should exhibit e.g. a common programming style and how the software process should be enacted
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Importance of standards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Encapsulation of best practice – \textbf{avoids repetition} of past mistakes
  \item Framework for quality assurance process – it involves \textbf{checking standard compliance}
  \item \textbf{Provide continuity} – new staff can understand the organisation by understand the standards applied
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The benefits of using standards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The ability to \textbf{apply methodologies and procedures} of the highest professional level.
  \item Better \textbf{mutual understanding} and coordination among development teams but especially between development and maintenance teams.
  \item \textbf{Greater cooperation} between the software developer and external participants in the project.
  \item Better understanding and cooperation between suppliers and customers, based on the adoption of standards as part of the contract
\end{itemize}

\section{SQM classes}

\end{center}

\subsection{Certification standards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Enable a software development organization to demonstrate \textbf{consistent ability} to assure acceptable quality of its software products or maintenance services. Certification is granted by an \textbf{external body}
  \item Serve as an agreed-upon basis for customer and \textbf{supplier evaluation} of the supplier’s quality management system. Accomplished by performance of a quality audit by the customer.
  \item Support the organization's efforts to improve its quality management system through compliance with the standard’s requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assessment standards}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Serve organizations as a \textbf{tool for self-assessment} of their ability to carry out software development projects.
  \item Serve for \textbf{improvement of development} and maintenance processes by application of the standard directions
  \item Help purchasing organizations \textbf{to determine the capabilities} of potential suppliers.
  \item Guide training of assessor by \textbf{delineating qualifications and training program curricula}. its quality management system through compliance with the standard’s requirements.
\end{itemize}

\section{ISO 9000}
\begin{flushleft}
International set of standards for quality management. Applicable to a range of organisations from manufacturing to service industries. \textbf{ISO 9001}:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
  \item is the current standard to which organisations can be certified
  \item applicable to organisations which design, develop and maintain products
  \item is a generic model of the quality process that must be instantiated for each organisation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ISO 9001 Certification}

\begin{flushleft}
Quality standards and procedures should be documented in an organisational quality manual. \textbf{External body} may certify that an organisation’s quality manual conforms to \textbf{ISO 9001} standards. Customers are, increasingly, demanding that suppliers are \textbf{ISO 9001} certified

\subsection{Certification Process}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{certification_process.png}
\end{center}

\section{Capability Maturity Model (CMM)}
\begin{flushleft}
The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) is a methodology used to develop and refine an organization's software development process.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quantitative management methods increases the organization's capability to control the quality and improve the productivity.
  \item Application of the five-level capability maturity model that enables to evaluate the achievements and determine the efforts needed to reach the next capability.
  \item Generic process areas that define the “what” — not “how” enables the model's applicability to a wide range of implementation organizations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Allows use of any life cycle model.
    \item Allows use of any design methodology, development tool and programming language.
    \item Does not specify any particular documentation standard.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparison of ISO 9000 vs CMM}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{cmm_vs_iso.png}
\end{center}

\section{Problems with standards}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Not seen as relevant and up-to-date by software engineers
  \item Involve too much bureaucratic form filling
  \item Unsupported by software tools so tedious manual work is involved to maintain standards
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overcoming the Problems}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Involve practitioners in development: Engineers should understand the rationale underlying a standard
  \item Review standards and their usage regularly: Standards can quickly become outdated and this reduces their credibility amongst practitioners
  \item Detailed standards should have associated tool support: Excessive clerical work is the most significant complaint against standards
\end{itemize}

\section{Process and product quality}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The quality of a developed product is influenced by the \textbf{quality of the production process}
  \item Form (product) follows function (process)
  \item Particularly important in software development as some product quality attributes are hard to assess
  \item However, there is a very complex and poorly understood relationship between software processes and product quality
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Process-based quality}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Straightforward link between process and product in manufactured goods, but way more complex for software because:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The application of individual skills and experience is particularly
important in software development
    \item External factors such as the novelty of an application or the need for an
accelerated development schedule may impair product quality
  \end{itemize}
  \item Care must be taken not to impose \textbf{inappropriate process standards}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical process quality}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Define} process standards such as how reviews should be conducted,
configuration management, etc.
  \item \textbf{Monitor} the development process to ensure that standards are being followed
  \item \textbf{Report} on the process to project management and software procurer
\end{itemize}

\section{Quality planning}

\begin{itemize}
  \item A quality plan sets out the \textbf{desired product qualities} and how these are \textbf{assessed} and define the most \textbf{significant assessed}
  \item It should define the quality assessment process
  \item It should set out which organisational standards should be applied and, if necessary, define new standards.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{structure}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Product introduction
  \item Product plans
  \item Process descriptions
  \item Quality goals
  \item Risks and risk management
  \item Quality plans should be short, succinct documents – If they are too long, \textbf{no-one will read them}
\end{itemize}
