When looking at github commits, some might say username of Knightls or Augustinas, that happened because I had configured github incorrectly. All the charts are taken from and can be confirmed on \href{https://npm-stat.com}{npm-stat}

\subsection{About}

\begin{flushleft}
This project was created on \textbf{05/02/2017} and can be found on \href{https://github.com/WhoAteDaCake/dlister}{Github}. \\
It's a cli tool, which allows to quickly and easily list directory trees and files within them. It's build on top of node.js which allows it to be used as a universal tool with extremely simple installation on a large number of operating systems. Dlister also has a stackoverflow integration allowing for painless project layout display when creating a question. I am currently the sole maintainer of the project, which lead to development being slowed down recently, however there are plans for a complete rewrite in ocaml using bucklescript compiler to transform it to javascript. This would mean being able to utilise ocaml's type system to produce better quality code.
