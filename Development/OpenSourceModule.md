### About

This was my first published npm package, it was made because I found that there were no directory tree lister that suited my needs. The main issue was that when posting to stackoverflow, you would need to manually indent every line by 4 spaces, so I wrote a package that does that for me.

### About
I created this package when while working on multiple react projects. While working with react I realised that without routing, generated JavaScript bundles used to run pages would be way too large and dynamic route loading was way harder than it needed to be.

### About

This package was created as part of learning experience for reasonml, new language written by facebook. I've been part of reasonml community for few months now and I have noticed that it was missing a lot crucial packages for web development. So I took upon myself to help the community and ported this package from JavaScript one.

## About

I wrote this package as part of my initiative to give back to open-source community. I discussed it with my boss and began open sourcing the code that I've been working on. It was a very good experience because this made me think about architecture of open-source projects. I learned how to write documentation, setup continuous integration as well as how to release packages based on semantic versioning system

This package is a fork of [react-lazylog](https://github.com/mozilla-frontend-infra/react-lazylog). It uses fundamentals of the forked project, however it's purpose is vastly different. It has been made to allow large files (< 30mb in size) to be readable and dynamically loaded in the browser. It also features a fully functional text and positional entity search. **Documentation is still work in progress**
